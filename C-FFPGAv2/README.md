## Performance Optimization

### Compilation Flags Used
- `-O3`: Maximum optimization level
- `-march=native`: Optimize for current CPU
- `-mtune=native`: Tune for current CPU microarchitecture
- `-ffast-math`: Enable fast floating-point optimizations
- `-funroll-loops`: Unroll loops for better performance
- `-flto`: Link-time optimization for cross-function optimization

### Algorithm Optimizations
1. **Early Escape Detection**: Cardioid and bulb detection eliminates ~75% of calculations
2. **Cached Computations**: Pre-calculates squared values to avoid redundant operations
3. **Smooth Iteration Counting**: Uses logarithmic smoothing for better color gradients
4. **Optimized Color Mapping**: Fast trigonometric color generation

## Expected Performance

### Typical Generation Times (on modern hardware)
- **1920x1080, 1000 iterations**: 2-5 seconds
- **3840x2160 (4K), 1000 iterations**: 8-15 seconds
- **1920x1080, 5000 iterations**: 10-25 seconds

### Performance varies based on:
- CPU speed and architecture
- Zoom level (higher zoom may require more iterations)
- Region complexity (some areas converge faster)
- Available system memory

## File Structure

```

├── build_and_run.bat      # Windows build script
├── stb_image_write.h      # PNG writing library (auto-downloaded)
├── ffpga.exe         # Compiled executable

└── README.md              # This file
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**:
   - Ensure GCC is installed and in PATH
   - On Windows, install MinGW or use WSL
   - Try removing `-march=native` flag for older systems

2. **Memory Errors**:
   - Reduce image resolution for systems with limited RAM
   - Large images (>4K) may require 4GB+ RAM

3. **Slow Generation**:
   - Reduce iteration count for faster generation
   - Use lower resolution for testing
   - Ensure using optimized compilation flags

### Manual Compilation

If the batch script doesn't work, try manual compilation:

```bash
# Download stb_image_write.h first
gcc -O3 -ffast-math ffpga.c -o ffpga -lm
```

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Generation Script
Create multiple images with different parameters:

```batch
@echo off
REM Generate a series of zoom images
for /L %%i in (1,1,10) do (
    set /A zoom=%%i*10
    ffpga.exe 800 600 1500 !zoom! -0.7269 0.1889 zoom_%%i.png
)
```

### Parameter Exploration
Use different iteration counts based on zoom level:
- Zoom 1-10: 1000 iterations
- Zoom 10-100: 2000 iterations  
- Zoom 100+: 3000+ iterations

## Mathematical Background

The ffpga set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the sequence:
```
z₀ = 0
zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + c
```

Does not diverge (remains bounded). This implementation uses several optimizations:

1. **Escape Radius**: Points are considered divergent when |z| > 2
2. **Smooth Coloring**: Uses continuous iteration count for gradient colors
3. **Early Detection**: Mathematical shortcuts identify set membership quickly
